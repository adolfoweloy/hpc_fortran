# HPC (High Performance Computing) with FORTRAN

I have created this repository to share some source code I've written
based on examples presented on High Performance Computing book when having
classes on Parallel and Distributed Systems at IME-USP.

When running this programs I've faced some doubts that I will document here
whenever it's possible.

## Doubts

- Why running the example that should use unit-stride within the inner loop of a matrix multiplication, wasn't better than non-unit-stride version regarding their execution times?
